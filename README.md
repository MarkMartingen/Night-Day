# Night-Day
I was always interested how to determine the duration of daylight on particular days of the year given some latitude. One can easily find procedures or formulas for this on the Internet. However, these tend to come with liitle or no explanations. This obejctive of this fun project is to come up with a straightforward, basic mathematical model of daylight duration given time of year and latitude. 

* **Night_Day.pdf** - is a weritten report in which I describe in detail how calcualtions are performed and compare some of my results to those found on the Internet
* **python_script.py** - thr script calculates daylight time for Warsaw and Sydnej and plots results.
* **Warsaw_daylight.csv** - file from Internet containing daylight time for Warsaw
* **Sydney_daylight.csv** - file from Internet containing daylight time for Sydney
